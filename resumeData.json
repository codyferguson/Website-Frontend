Then I moved to the Merchandising Engineering team where I began working on an internal planning software. I started by implementing improvements to buy worksheets functionality. I was then moved to the program planning where we designed new functionality around planning many programs under one planner which greatly increased their productivity. I took this time to refactor code from the Angular components to reuse for bulk actions which decoupled the logic into a service file. I also lead the conversion of our batch job orchestration from running on a mainframe to using Airflow which aligned with Kohl's move off the mainframe."

I was quickly exposed to enterprise projects, and learned a great amount during the rotation"
